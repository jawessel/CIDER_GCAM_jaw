# CIDER
 The Climate Intervention Dynamical EmulatoR is a lightweight, reduced-order model that allows for exploration of highly dynamic geoengineering scenarios, including uncoordinated deployment and termination. The emulator in CIDER_code is written in Python, and another MATLAB version is included along with the figure replication code in Supplementary_code.
